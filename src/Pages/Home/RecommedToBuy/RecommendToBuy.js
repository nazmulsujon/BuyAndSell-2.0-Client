              We’re shouting it from the rooftops—secondhand furniture should be your first choice! In fact, well-made
              used furniture can last through generations. Furniture holds memories. We gather around it in times of joy
              and celebration; we curl up with our loved ones on it; we use it to store our most-prized possessions.
              Buying pre-loved furniture adds character to your home through its imperfections and the stories it
              carries. We’re here to continue those stories and create a world where furniture is circular, sustainable,
              and here to stay.
